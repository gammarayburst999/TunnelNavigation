# TunnelNavigation
Implementation of a reactive control algorithm for an autonomous drone  in a tunnel-like environment with static obstacles in MATLAB

This is a simple implementation of the work from the research paper https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9318399

The Simulink model needs at least 2018a or higher version MATLAB


How to run this.

STEP 1 - Include the folders from https://github.com/mattools/matGeom.git . I have used already pre-built functions from it. 
STEP 2 - run piby5.m file

This project was done in collaboration with Rasmus Visgaard
